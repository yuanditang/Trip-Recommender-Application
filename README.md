## Project Overview

The **Trip Recommender Application** helps users discover personalized travel destinations based on preferences such as budget, climate, trip duration, and origin city. It leverages real-time APIs, a custom-built recommendation engine, and a user-friendly interface to generate curated travel suggestions.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  Weather, cost of living, attractions, and more

- **Smart Recommendation Engine:**  
  Matches user preferences with destination data

- **Custom Database:**  
  Efficient storage and retrieval of API data

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Web UI for inputs and travel suggestions

---

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap, Numbeo, Travel Advisor, others

## Project Planning & Management

### 1. Project Kickoff
- **Goals:** Create a functional, user-friendly trip recommendation app based on real-time destination data and user preferences.
- **Scope Definition:** Focus only on core features (data retrieval, UI, logic). Exclude advanced ML, account systems, or booking features.
- **Phase Deliverables:** APIs selected → DB schema built → Logic implemented → UI integrated → Testing and final delivery
- **Milestones:** Aligned to 8-week timeline above
- **Team Capabilities:** Adequate for MVP. Minor upskilling needed for front-end frameworks and API optimization.
- **Dataset Availability:** No static dataset; real-time API data will be pulled and stored dynamically.

### 2. Team Discussions
- **Core Skills:**
  - John: Data modeling, backend development, logic design
  - Yuandi: Front-end design, integration, performance optimization
- **Missing Skills:** None critical; slight gap in front-end polish (addressed with Bootstrap)
- **Tool Experience:** Python, Flask, Git, basic SQL; need familiarity with React/Bootstrap
- **Language/Platform Choice:** Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap or plain HTML/CSS

### 3. Skills & Tools Assessment
- **External Resources:** Rely on course mentors and documentation
- **Best-Suited Tools:** Flask, PostgreSQL, requests, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap
- **Tool Comfort:** Shared documentation and setup sessions will ensure alignment
- **Role Assignments:** Tasks distributed by individual strengths (see Work Distribution above)

### 4. Initial Setup
- **Environment:** Python virtualenv, GitHub repo, API keys configured
- **Version Control:** GitHub repo with branches for dev, features
- **Libraries Installed:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, requests, dotenv
- **Testing:** API response validation, DB test inserts, UI rendering
- **Troubleshooting Plan:** Use logs, debug mode, and shared setup doc

### 5. Progress Review
- **Achievements:** Repo setup, APIs researched, DB schema drafted
- **Issues:** Some APIs have limits or missing data (workarounds planned)
- **Team Contributions:** Balanced as expected
- **Timeline Check:** On track
- **Objective Alignment:** MVP features being implemented within scope

### 6. Plan Revision
- **Timeline Adjustments:** Add buffer before Week 8 for UI testing
- **Task Reassignments:** Assist where needed on integration and testing
- **Next Steps:** Focused check-ins weekly; assign goals per sprint
- **Communication:** Slack (daily), GitHub Issues (task tracking), weekly summary doc
- **Progress Tracking:** GitHub Projects / Kanban board with milestones
